        <h2>Our Commitment to Your Privacy</h2>
        <p>Palestine Support Hub is designed to be a privacy-focused tool. We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information about you or your Browse activity.</p>

        <h2>What Data is Stored and Why?</h2>
        <p>The extension stores a small amount of data on your computer for functionality. This data is never sent to us or any third party.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Theme Preference:</strong> To remember your chosen theme (Light, Dark, or Green), we use <code>chrome.storage.sync</code>. This is synced with your Google account so your theme preference is consistent across your devices, but it is not accessible to us.</li>
            <li><strong>News & Content Cache:</strong> To make the extension load faster, we temporarily store news articles, the current "Word of the Hour," and the current Quran verse using <code>chrome.storage.local</code>. This data is stored only on your local machine.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data We Do Not Collect</h2>
        <p>We do not collect any analytics, track your Browse history, or log your interactions with the extension.</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>When you click on a link within the extension (such as a news article or a link to an activist group), you will be directed to an external website. These third-party sites have their own privacy policies, and we encourage you to read them.</p>
        <p>The extension fetches news from public RSS feeds. This process involves your browser making a direct request to those news services, which is standard internet behavior.</p>

        <h2>Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please contact us at mdanwarulislamshawn@gmail.com</p>
